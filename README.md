# AI Image Generator

AI Image Generator with OpenAI and Node.js

## Description

This project uses the OpenAI API to generate images based on a prompt. The prompt is a description of the image you want to generate. The API will then generate an image based on the prompt. There are 3 different image sizes to choose from (small, medium, large). The images are generated using the [DALL-E](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/) model.
